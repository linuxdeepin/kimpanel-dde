The `org.kde.kimpanel.inputmethod` D-Bus interface is used by input method engines to communicate with the kimpanel UI components, sending signals about text composition state, candidate selection, and input method properties. Based on the codebase, this interface is consumed by the kimpanel extension which subscribes to its signals and updates the UI accordingly.

## D-Bus Signal Subscription and Processing

The kimpanel extension subscribes to all signals from the `org.kde.kimpanel.inputmethod` interface through a single subscription.

Newly handled signals and exposed state:
- `Enable(bool)`: updates `PanelAdaptor.enabled` (QML property)
- `ShowAux(bool)`: updates `PanelAdaptor.auxVisible`
- `ShowLookupTable(bool)`: updates `PanelAdaptor.lookupVisible`
- `UpdateAux(QString text, QString attr)`: updates `PanelAdaptor.auxText` (attributes ignored for now)

In QML, the panel content visibility binds to `lookupVisible || auxVisible`, and the auxiliary text is shown when `auxVisible` is true.

## Signal Types and Meanings

### Text Composition Signals

**UpdateSpotLocation** - Sets the cursor position for the input panel:
- Parameters: `x, y` coordinates 
- Reaction: Updates internal position state and triggers UI repositioning

**UpdatePreeditText** - Updates the composition text being typed:
- Parameters: `text` string
- Reaction: Updates preedit display in the input panel

**UpdateAux** - Updates auxiliary text (often pronunciation or hints):
- Parameters: `text` string and `attr` string (ignored initially)
- Reaction: Updates `auxText` and shows it when `ShowAux(true)` is received

**UpdateLookupTable** - Updates candidate selection list:
- Parameters: `labels` array, `texts` array
- Reaction: Updates candidate list in input panel

### Display Control Signals

**ShowPreedit/ShowLookupTable/ShowAux** - Controls visibility of UI components:
- Parameters: `boolean` visibility flag
- Reaction: Shows/hides respective UI elements

### Input Method State Signals

**Enable/Disable** - Controls input method activation state:
- Parameters: `boolean` enabled state
- Reaction: Updates indicator appearance (active/inactive)

**RegisterProperties** - Registers input method properties/settings:
- Parameters: `properties` array
- Reaction: Updates indicator menu with property items

**UpdateProperty** - Updates a specific property state:
- Parameters: `property` object
- Reaction: Updates property display in indicator

## Implementation Pattern

Your implementation should follow this pattern:

1. **Subscribe to signals** from `org.kde.kimpanel.inputmethod` interface 

2. **Maintain internal state** for all composition data (preedit, aux, lookup table, positions)

3. **Process signals centrally** with change detection to avoid unnecessary UI updates

4. **Update UI components** through a coordinated update method that handles all visible elements

## Notes

The interface name suggests this is part of KDE's input method protocol, but it's implemented by various input method engines (like Fcitx) to provide a standardized way to communicate composition state to panel implementations. The signals follow a pattern where state-changing signals trigger UI updates, while property-related signals manage the input method's configuration interface.
